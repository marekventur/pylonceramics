This one's fresh from the kiln and making me feel quite excited. I have also finally decided what to call this new glaze: eucalyptus. After lots of head scratching and all your suggestions, I felt it looked most like the beautifully blue-green leaves of eucalyptus gunii. And this pot is as round as it's leaves. 
Pot is coming to @canopy_market @realfoodfest in King's Cross tomorrow.
