Autumn has arrived but one of my strawberry plants seems to be rather confused about this because it's flowering. 🤷🏻‍♀️ The flowers are too pretty to let go to waste, so they are now brightening up the house and this little bug vase is just the right size. 
You can get your hands on it at @greenwich_peninsula_market this weekend!
Saturday+Sunday 11-6pm
outside North Greenwich station/the O2 Arena
