It's always fascinating to me which glazes are the most popular on a given day at a market. Taking this past weekend as an example, it was a pretty even spread on Friday, my dark green drippy glaze was the most popular on Saturday and then this white speckled one was half the sales on Sunday. Why? Anyone have any ideas?
