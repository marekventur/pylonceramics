Starting the year off with reclaiming clay that's been marinating over the holidays. 
I keep all the water used for throwing and soak the dried out trimmings to make clay that can be turned into new pots. The clay slurry seen here is being dried on plaster bats for a while until it's firm enough to we wedged and I ended to rove air bubbles. Then it's ready to become new work.
