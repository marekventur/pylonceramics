Coffee break in the sun as I'm getting ready for this weekend's market. @greenwich_peninsula_market Just outside the O2 and North Greenwich Station. 
The mango and lime tart is the perfect no-bake treat and made after a recipe by @bakedbybenji that I mostly veganised, except I could only find standard gelatine at the local shop.
