I've been working my socks off to get more work ready for @canopy_market @realfoodfest this weekend. The kiln is on and I'm praying to the kiln god's for a good glaze firing. I'll have mugs! Some with handles, some without and more spoon rests because they were all snapped up on the Bank holiday weekend.
