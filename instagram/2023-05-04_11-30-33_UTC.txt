Mushrooms in the garden.
A fresh batch is waiting for glaze firing atm. I've been really enjoying making these, not only because they are new (and therefore exciting), but because they allow me to play around with glazes a lot more. I have a bunch of glaze test pots and little bottles of glaze I've inherited from different places that are too small for bigger pieces, but are perfect for these little shrooms.
