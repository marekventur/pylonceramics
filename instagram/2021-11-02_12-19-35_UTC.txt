On the to-do list today: glazing, glazing, glazing. 
I'll be bringing a bunch new pieces to @canopy_market @realfoodfest this weekend. Here they are after their first firing, also known as bisque, and are a delightful pink. Whish I could keep them like this, but they are still fragile at this stage and very absorbent.
