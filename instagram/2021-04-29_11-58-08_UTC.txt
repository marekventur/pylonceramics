Lots of cups and a handful of mugs were glazed on Tuesday and I'm about to go and unload the kiln now. 🤞🏻 Hope it was a good glaze firing! 
All that turned out nice will be coming to @canopy_market @realfoodfest this weekend, Fri - Mon. 
These pieces here have been fired once. After that I give them a light sanding to remove any burrs or sharp corners before glazing and firing them again. I love their blush pink colour at this stage.
