Working on something new: flat white cups! 🍵 
I've had several requests for slightly smaller cups and I've finally decided to start making them. Here is one next to my current size cups at the leather hard stage after they were trimmed. Fingers crossed my calculations are correct and they will hold 6-7oz once fully fired. 🤞🏻
