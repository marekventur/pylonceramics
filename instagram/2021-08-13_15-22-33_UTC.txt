It's one of those very rare occasions where I actually have a few travel cups in stock! 
Maybe I'm finally getting better at making cups to size? Or just luck? Either way, get them while they last! Some have silicone lids, others fit the spill proof plastic lids. All come with my handmade cork sleeves.
