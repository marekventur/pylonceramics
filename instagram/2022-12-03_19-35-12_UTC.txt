It's Small Business Saturday and there is no better way to celebrate than with the release of the new @east_end_trades_guild maps! 
They cover Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest respectively and are a great way of discovering your new favourite caf√©, local craftsperson or mechanic. 
The Hackney edition was designed and printed by @duplikatpress.
