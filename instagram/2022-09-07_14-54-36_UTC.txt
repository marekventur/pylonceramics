In need of some new pottery? Next weekend we have the wonderful @pylon_ceramics trading with us back under the canopy, with their beautiful handmade pottery inspired by the flora of Hackney Marshes! âœ¨

Kat called her business Pylon ceramics because of the large transmission towers all throughout the marshes, utilitarian structures that both stand out and fit into the nature that surrounds them. All of her pieces are thrown on a potters wheel and decorated in a range of carefully selected glazes.

Kat hopes that you see the same combination of usefulness and beauty in her pieces, as she does in the electrical pylons of Hackney Marshes! Come and see her next weekend (16th - 18th) and find something special.
