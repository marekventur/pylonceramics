Spring is in the air! So excited to be sitting out in the garden after lunch to enjoy some coffee and vitamin D before I head to the studio to work on a fresh batch of coffee cups. 
Being self employed often results in working at all hours, so I often have to remind myself to also take advantage of being my own boss and take some time off when it's a glorious day like today. I feel much more motivated after my extended lunch and coffee break in the sunshine.
