{"aboutMe": "Hi! I'm Kat and I'm running a small pottery business in East London, making functional ceramics inspired by the flora of Hackney Marshes. It's called Pylon Ceramics, because of the large transmission towers all throughout the marshes \u2014 utilitarian structures that both stand out and fit into the nature that surounds it. All my pieces are thrown on a potter\u2019s wheel and decorated in a range of carefully selected glazes. I love the tactile nature of unglazed stoneware clay and deliberate shapes of functional ceramics. My hope is that you see the same combination of usefulness and beauty in my pieces that I see in the electrical pylons of Hackney Marshes.", "events": "Find me at these events: \n\n**19th June 2021** \n[Local Makers Market - Wanstead](https://www.facebook.com/events/900877283996864), \nChrist Church Hall, Wanstead, E11 2SW\n\n**5th June 2021**\n[Local Makers Market - Stoke Newington](https://www.facebook.com/events/445631410111687), \n73A Stoke Newington Church Street, Stoke Newington, N16 0AS\n\n**18-19th September 2021**\n[Independent Ceramics Market - part of London Design Festival 2021](https://www.facebook.com/events/408896936989270)\nRich Mix, 35 - 47 Bethnal Green Road, Shoreditch, E1 6LA\n\n**11th December 2021**\n[Independent Ceramics Market - Rich Mix](https://www.facebook.com/events/1178198856336768)\nRich Mix, 35 - 47 Bethnal Green Road, Shoreditch, E1 6LA\n"}
