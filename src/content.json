{"aboutMe": "Hi! I'm Kat and I'm running a small pottery business in East London, making functional ceramics inspired by the flora of Hackney Marshes. It's called Pylon Ceramics, because of the large transmission towers all throughout the marshes \u2014 utilitarian structures that both stand out and fit into the nature that surounds it. All my pieces are thrown on a potter\u2019s wheel and decorated in a range of carefully selected glazes. I love the tactile nature of unglazed stoneware clay and deliberate shapes of functional ceramics. My hope is that you see the same combination of usefulness and beauty in my pieces that I see in the electrical pylons of Hackney Marshes.", "events": "**Find me at these events:**\n\n**11th-13th April**\n[Canopy Market](https://canopymarket.co.uk)\nWest Handyside Canopy, off Granary Square, Kings Cross, [N1C 4BH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f5nJ5KAdtoPUWQJW7)\n\n**26th - 27th April**\n[Elephant Park Market](https://elephantparkmarket.co.uk)\nElephant Park, Sayer Street, Elephant & Castle, [SE17 1HL](https://maps.app.goo.gl/neJTDn3FdLsX977n7)\n\n**9th-11th May**\n[Canopy Market](https://canopymarket.co.uk)\nWest Handyside Canopy, off Granary Square, Kings Cross, [N1C 4BH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f5nJ5KAdtoPUWQJW7)\n\n**18th May**\n[Urban Village Fete](https://www.hemingwaydesign.co.uk/projects/urban-village-fete/)\nPeninsula Square, Greenwich Peninsula, North Greenwich, [SE10 0ES](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nrM5WgWbYyW1YacC8)\n\n**6th-8th June**\n[Canopy Market](https://canopymarket.co.uk)\nWest Handyside Canopy, off Granary Square, Kings Cross, [N1C 4BH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f5nJ5KAdtoPUWQJW7)\n\n**28th - 29th June**\n[Elephant Park Market](https://elephantparkmarket.co.uk)\nElephant Park, Sayer Street, Elephant & Castle, [SE17 1HL](https://maps.app.goo.gl/neJTDn3FdLsX977n7)\n\n"}
