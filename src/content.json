{"aboutMe": "Hi! I'm Kat, the maker behind Pylon Ceramics - a one-woman pottery studio based in East London. I create handmade, functional pieces like mugs, bowls, spoon rests, vases, and jars, all thrown on the wheel and finished with love and care.\n\nMy work is inspired by the little pockets of wild nature that peek through the urban landscape of London, and the beautiful contrast they create with the city\u2019s industrial edges. Each piece is glazed in soft, complementary colours, with part of the surface left unglazed to reveal the raw clay. This not only highlights the natural texture of the material but adds a calming, tactile quality - encouraging a moment of mindfulness with every use.\n\nSustainability is really important to me. I use green energy in the studio, recycle all clay scraps, and package everything in fully recyclable materials. \n", "events": "**Find me at these events:**\n\n**27th February - 1st March**\n[Canopy Market](https://canopymarket.co.uk)\nWest Handyside Canopy, off Granary Square, Kings Cross, [N1C 4BH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f5nJ5KAdtoPUWQJW7)\n\n**13th March - 15th March**\n[Canopy Market](https://canopymarket.co.uk)\nWest Handyside Canopy, off Granary Square, Kings Cross, [N1C 4BH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f5nJ5KAdtoPUWQJW7)\n\n**27th March - 29th March**\n[Canopy Market](https://canopymarket.co.uk)\nWest Handyside Canopy, off Granary Square, Kings Cross, [N1C 4BH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f5nJ5KAdtoPUWQJW7)\n"}
