Hi! I'm Kat and I'm running a small pottery business in East London, making functional ceramics inspired by the flora of Hackney Marshes. It's called Pylon Ceramics, because of the large transmission towers all throughout the marshes — utilitarian structures that both stand out and fit into the nature that surounds it. All my pieces are thrown on a potter’s wheel and decorated in a range of carefully selected glazes. I love the tactile nature of unglazed stoneware clay and deliberate shapes of functional ceramics. My hope is that you see the same combination of usefulness and beauty in my pieces that I see in the electrical pylons of Hackney Marshes.
